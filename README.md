Spacebar Counter Application
A simple spacebar counter application built using Python with Tkinter for the GUI and keyboard for global hotkey functionality. This project serves as a lightweight tool for tracking spacebar presses and provides features for saving and displaying counts.

üöÄ Project Overview
This spacebar counter application includes:

Global hotkey support for spacebar presses and reset functionality with Ctrl + R.
A graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter.
History tracking of previous counts that can be viewed in a separate window.
Responsive window layout that remains on top of other windows for easy access.
üíª Technologies Used

Python 3
Tkinter (for the GUI)
Keyboard library (for global hotkey functionality)
‚ú® Key Features

Spacebar press tracking: Counts the number of spacebar presses.
Reset functionality: Resets the count using Ctrl + R.
Count history: Shows a running history of previous counts.
Responsive GUI: The window stays on top of all other windows for easy use.
History window: A separate window that displays previous counts, opened from the main window.
Cross-platform support: Should work across different operating systems with the necessary libraries installed.
üé® Design
The design was built with simplicity and functionality in mind, focusing on:

Minimalistic interface with large font display for the current count.
Smooth user interaction through button clicks and hotkeys.
Clear and straightforward display of previous counts in a secondary window.
üåê Live Demo
Since this project runs locally, there isn't a live site. However, you can compile the Python code into an executable (.exe) to run it on any machine.

üìö What I Learned
This project helped me master:

Building a Python application with a GUI using Tkinter.
Implementing global hotkeys using the keyboard library.
Managing event-driven programming in Python.
Saving and displaying persistent data (previous counts).
Packaging Python applications into an executable format using PyInstaller.

üíº View the project:
To use this spacebar counter, clone this repository and run the global_spacebar_counter.py file, or build an executable using PyInstaller:

bash
Copy the code
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon="your_icon.ico" global_spacebar_counter.py
